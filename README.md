# Data Structures in Real Life 📚💡

Welcome to the **Data Structures in Real Life** project! 🚀 This repository explores how data structures are applied in everyday scenarios. From organizing your digital life to optimizing complex systems, we dive into practical examples that showcase the power of data structures.

## 📂 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of various data structures in real-life applications, including:

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** 🌳: Used in storing sorted data, like in databases and file systems.
- **Linked Lists** 🔗: Found in music players, image viewers, and browser history, allowing sequential access.
- **Stacks & Queues** 🗂️: Essential for undo/redo functionality, task scheduling, and handling function calls in programming.
- **Hash Tables** 🔍: Powering fast data retrieval in databases, caches, and symbol tables used by compilers.
